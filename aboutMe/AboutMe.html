	<p>My general goal is to learn as much as I possible can.<br>I feel working with all of you will help me reach toward achieving that goal.
    <br>We've been born into a world where people see computers as tools, entertainment and a way of life.
    <br>I want to be a part of this world that never would have been thought possible just decades ago.</p>
